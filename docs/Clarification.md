1. Are there any particular design or styling requirements for the front end, or can I use my creativity to design the UI?

-   You may use any styling you like although if making custom styling we prefer scss over css. As for pre-built styling you may also use Google Material / Bootstrap / etc

2.  Is there any particular format, type, or style you'd like for the error messages?

-   No particular format. You can use our current error handling experience on the checkout page on [paige.com](http://paige.com) as a reference to how its currently done.

3.  What type of input should be used for the filter by color function? Should it be a dropdown menu with predefined color options or a text input field where users can enter any color they want? Additionally, if it is a dropdown, should the filter allow selecting multiple colors at once or only one color at a time?

-   We are looking for selectors over text input for filtering. If you select both black and blue it should show both.

4.  How should the filter by-color function work? Should it filter by exact color match or include products with similar colors? For example, if a user selects 'blue' from the filter, should the table only display products with an exact color match of 'blue' or similar colors such as 'navy blue' or 'light blue'?"

-   Exact match is fine with similar being extra credit.
